Preprocess the data: This involves cleaning the text, removing punctuation, converting all text to lowercase, and splitting the text into individual words (tokenization).

Build vocabularies for the source and target languages: This involves creating a list of unique words in each language.

Convert the words in your sentences to integers: This involves replacing each word in your sentences with the corresponding integer from your vocabularies.

Create the seq2seq model: This typically involves creating an encoder and a decoder. The encoder processes the input sentence and compresses the information into a context vector. The decoder takes this context vector and produces the translated sentence.

Train the model: This involves feeding your sentences into the model, calculating the loss (how far the model's output is from the desired output), and updating the model's weights to minimize the loss.

Evaluate the model: This involves testing the model on unseen data and checking how well it translates the sentences.
